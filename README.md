# kompis-os: A Decentralized Operating, Organisation & Orchestration System

kompis-os is a NixOS-based framework for building, managing, and scaling your
own sovereign peer cloud. It's a practical toolkit for collectives,
homelabbers, or independent providers who want to run capable, self-sustaining
services without giving up control.

This system provides the tools to manage everything from servers and
workstations to networks and secrets, supporting multiple independent
trust-chains and secure, user-controlled tenants.

It's built from the ground up for GDPR-compliance and uses modern security
practices to enable true data ownership.

Whether you have funds, hardware, time, or a belief in the mission,
hereâ€™s how you can join.

## 1. For Supporters & Patrons
### Who you are:
You believe in a free and user-owned internet. You may not have
the time or technical expertise to build it, but you want to provide the
foundation for those who can.

### Your Venue: Donate hardware or funds.
A decentralized cloud is built on real hardware. Your contribution directly pays
for the core servers, domains, and development time that keep the collective
running and growing.

### The Reward:
You become a foundational patron of a more ethical web,
enabling a secure digital commons for everyone.

## 2. For Users, Families, & Collectives
### Who you are:
You're a group of friends, a family, a non-profit, or an artist
collective. You desperately want a capable, private alternative to Google or
Microsoft 365, but you don't want to be a system administrator.

### Your Venue: Become a hosted member.
Let us be your provider. We can host your Nextcloud,
email, websites, and other services on the Kompis-OS infrastructure.
You get a secure, modern service, and we can explore models where you have your
own "backdoors" (like encryption keys) that only you control.

### The Reward:
You get the peace of mind of a fully-managed, user-owned cloud, knowing
your data is safe and your money is supporting an independent,
federated internet.

## 3. For Self-Hosters & DIY "Sovereigns"
### Who you are:
You're a "homelabber" or a technical user who lives by the motto:
"There's no cloud, just someone else's computer."

### Your Venue:
Fork, adapt, and self-host. This entire repository is your toolkit.
Use it to build and manage your own sovereign cloud for you, your family,
or your business.

### The Reward:
Whether our paths will merge or not, kompis-os gives you a massive
head start.

## 4. For Hardware Peers & Providers
### Who you are:
You have a capable server in a rack, a fast internet connection,
or even just a powerful desktop that's always on. You believe in a truly
decentralized, federated internet and want to be a node in the network.

### Your Venue: Run hardware for the collective.
You can run Kompis-OS on your own metal and join the federation as a peer.
Your hardware can host services, provide geo-distributed backups, or become a
build-host, strengthening the entire network.

### The Reward:
You become a foundational pillar of the Kompis Cloud.
You're not a user; you are the cloud, helping to build a real,
high-performance, and resilient alternative to centralized providers.

## 5. For Developers, Architects, & Builders
### Who you are:
You're a Nix expert, a security pro, a SRE, a frontend developer,
or a UI/UX designer. You see this architecture, and you have ideas on how to
make it more robust, more scalable, or more user-friendly.

### Your Venue: Contribute your code and expertise.
Help us improve our modules,
harden our security, write better documentation, or design a "tenant" dashboard
that makes self-hosting simple for non-technical users.

### The Reward:
You get to shape the future of a system that defies centralization.
